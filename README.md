# GPS-Tracking-System #
- ## Description: ##
  - This project is imlpemented by using Tiva C microcontroller. The project is divided over 5 team members. Various components are used to implement the GPS Tracker.
  - The main concept is that the tracker led turns red while away from the destination, turns yellow when 5 meters or less away from the destination and green once reaching the destination.
  - Challenges faced were the distance calculation code and GPS module configuration and interfacing.
- ## Hardware Components: ##
    1. Tiva C microcontroller
    2. 16x2 LCD 
    3. GPS Module (NEO-6M)
    4. Jumpers 
    5. Breadboard 
- ## Programming Language: ##
    C
- ## Project Installation: ##
  1. Download the code files and libraries.
  2. Connect the jumpers to the microcontrollers and the modules.
  3. Power the microcontroller with a battery or power bank.
  4. Upload the code using an IDE like Keil uvision or Energia.
